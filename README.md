# Clark-County-GIS-Analysis
## Introduction
This project explores the relationship between housing and equity in Clark County. It focuses on the accessibility of affordable housing and aims to unravel patterns in poverty distribution, housing affordability, and demographic dynamics, particularly among BIPOC communities.

## Data Sources
- **Clark County, WA Open Data - Shapefile**: Used for geospatial analysis. [Clark County Shapefile]([#Clark-County-Shapefile-Link](https://hub-clarkcountywa.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/digital-gis-data-download))
- **HUD Data**: Includes data on [Fair Market Rents (FMRs)](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html#year2024) and [Small Area FMRs](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/smallarea/index.html#query_2024).
- **Census Data**: Provides demographic, employment, and income data. [Census Data Link](#Census-Data-Link)


## GIS Skills and Methodology
- **Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Application of Global Moranâ€™s I tests to study spatial patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Development of maps using R (`ggplot` and `geom_sf`) for spatial distribution visualization.
- **Tertile-Based Categorization**: Implemented in zipcode data analysis to understand spatial autocorrelation.
- **Advanced Data Manipulation**: Proficient in transforming, reshaping, and merging large datasets for GIS analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Economic Segregation**: Significant spatial clustering in income, indicating economic segregation.
- **BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) Community Distribution**: Strong spatial concentration of BIPOC populations in certain neighborhoods.
- **SNAP Utilization and Employment**: Notable clustering indicating potential links to economic conditions and housing affordability.
